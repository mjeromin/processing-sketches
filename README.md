# processing-sketches
These are some sketches I'm working in [processing](https://processing.org/) ([Python mode](http://py.processing.org/)). Like many other Processing sketches, it's a great outlet to improve programming skills, create some visual artwork / animation / interactive UI, and have fun.

## Pittsburgh Night
This sketch starts with a photo of the Pittsburgh skyline. During animation, it has lights turning on/off at random times for multiple buildings, randomly generated clouds, and the moon is given motion. Mouse click in the display will reveal your coordinates. The 'R' keypress will enable recording to TIFF frames. You will need a couple fonts from dafont.com: [Monofur](https://www.dafont.com/monofur.font) and [Hamburger Heaven](https://www.dafont.com/hamburger-heaven.font). Install these in your ~/.fonts directory (on Linux) or in the sketch directory.

tl;dr, a video was captured and uploaded to youtube:

## Laser Circle Sight
This sketch draws a circle with a line from the center to act as a sight. The sight will follow the mouse coordinates and on mouse click it will fire a laser beam.

## thermostat control interface 
This sketch inspired by an
[article](https://dev.to/ederchrono/making-an-animated-slider---wotw-mkj) from @ThePracticalDev. It simulates a thermostat interface and includes features such as:
* temperature slider
* fan toggle
* climate control mode display (ie. heating/cooling)
* environment temperature display (and simulated changes based on target temp)
* interface modes for:
  * Settings
  * Schedule
  * Metrics
  * Vacation
  * Beer
